Android Components Architecture in a Modular Word is a sample project that presents modern, 2020 approach to [Android](https://www.android.com/) application development using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and latest tech-stack.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate best practices, provide a set of guidelines, and present modern Android
application architecture that is modular, scalable, maintainable and testable. This application may look simple, but it
has all of these small details that will set the rock-solid foundation of the larger app suitable for bigger teams and
long application lifecycle management.

## Development

### Environment setup

First off, you require the latest Android Studio 4.1.0 (or newer) to be able to build the app.

You need to supply keys for Marvel API. You can find information about how to gain access by using the [link](https://developer.marvel.com).

When you obtain the keys, you can provide them to the app by putting the following in the `local.properties` project root file:

```properties
#Marvel API KEYS
marvel.key.public = <insert>
marvel.key.private = <insert>
```

### Code style

To maintain the style and quality of the code, are used the bellow static analysis tools. All of them use properly configuration and you find them in the project root directory `.{toolName}`.

| Tools                                                   | Config file                                                                       | Check command             | Fix command               |
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| [detekt](https://github.com/arturbosch/detekt)          | [/.detekt](https://github.com/vyshas/kotlin-sample-app/tree/master/.detekt)     | `./gradlew detekt`        | -                         |
| [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint)           | -                                                                                 | `./gradlew ktlint`        | `./gradlew ktlintFormat`  |
| [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless)        | [/.spotless](https://github.com/vyshas/kotlin-sample-app/tree/master/.spotless) | `./gradlew spotlessCheck` | `./gradlew spotlessApply` |
| [lint](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint) | [/.lint](https://github.com/vyshas/kotlin-sample-app/tree/master/.lint)         | `./gradlew lint`          | -                         |

All these tools are integrated in [pre-commit git hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks), in order
ensure that all static analysis and tests passes before you can commit your changes. To skip them for specific commit add this option at your git command:

```properties
git commit --no-verify
```

The pre-commit git hooks have exactly the same checks as [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and are defined in this [script](https://github.com/vyshas/kotlin-sample-app/blob/master/scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit.sh). This step ensures that all commits comply with the established rules. However the continuous integration will ultimately be validated that the changes are correct.

## Design

App [support different screen sizes](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screensizes) and the content has been adapted to fit for mobile devices and tablets. To do that, it has been created a flexible layout using one or more of the following concepts:

-   [Use constraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screensizes#ConstraintLayout)
-   [Avoid hard-coded layout sizes](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screensizes#TaskUseWrapMatchPar)
-   [Create alternative layouts](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screensizes#alternative-layouts)
-   [Use the smallest width qualifier](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screensizes#TaskUseSWQuali)
-   [Use the available width qualifier](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screensizes#available-width)
-   [Add orientation qualifiers](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screensizes#TaskUseOriQuali)

In terms of design has been followed recommendations [android material design](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel) comprehensive guide for visual, motion, and interaction design across platforms and devices. Granting the project in this way a great user experience (UX) and user interface (UI). For more info about UX best practices visit [link](https://developer.android.com/topic/google-play-instant/best-practices/apps).

Moreover, has been implemented support for [dark theme](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/darktheme) with the following benefits:
-   Can reduce power usage by a significant amount (depending on the device’s screen technology).
-   Improves visibility for users with low vision and those who are sensitive to bright light.
-   Makes it easier for anyone to use a device in a low-light environment.

## Architecture

The architecture of the application is based, apply and strictly complies with each of the following 5 points:

<img src="screenshots/architecture/project_structure.png" width="300" align="right" hspace="20">

-   A single-activity architecture, using the [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) to manage fragment operations.
-   [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), part of Android Jetpack for give to project a robust design, testable and maintainable.
-   Pattern [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) (MVVM) facilitating a [separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) of development of the graphical user interface.
-   [S.O.L.I.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.
-   [Modular app architecture](https://proandroiddev.com/build-a-modular-android-app-architecture-25342d99de82) allows to be developed features in isolation, independently from other features.

### Modules

Modules are collection of source files and build settings that allow you to divide a project into discrete units of functionality. In this case apart from dividing by functionality/responsibility, existing the following dependence between them:

<p align="center">
 <img src="screenshots/architecture/diagram_communication_modules.png">
</p>

The above graph shows the app modularisation:
-   `:app` depends on `:core` and indirectly depends on `:features` by dynamic-features.
-   `:features` modules depends on `:commons`, `:core`, `:libraries` and `:app`.
-   `:core` and `:commons` only depends for possible utils on `:libraries`.
-   `:libraries` don’t have any dependency.

#### App module

The `:app` module is an [com.android.application](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/), which is needed to create the app bundle.  It is also responsible for initiating the [dependency graph](https://github.com/google/dagger), [play core](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/play/core/release-notes) and another project global libraries, differentiating especially between different app environments.

<p align="center">
 <img src="screenshots/architecture/diagram_dependency_app.png">
</p>

#### Core module

The `:core` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library)  for serving network requests or accessing to the database. Providing the data source for the many features that require it.

<p align="center">
 <img src="screenshots/architecture/diagram_dependency_core.png">
</p>

#### Features modules

The `:features` module are an [com.android.dynamic-feature](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/dynamic-delivery) is essentially a gradle module which can be downloaded independently from the base application module. It can hold code and resources and include dependencies, just like any other gradle module.

| features                                                                                 |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <img src="screenshots/architecture/diagram_dependency_features_home.png">                |
| <img src="screenshots/architecture/diagram_dependency_features_characters_list.png">     |
| <img src="screenshots/architecture/diagram_dependency_features_characters_favorite.png"> |

#### Commons modules

The `:commons` modules are an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) only contains code and resources which are shared between feature modules. Reusing this way resources, layouts, views, and components in the different features modules, without the need to duplicate code.

| ui                                                                     | views                                                                     |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <img src="screenshots/architecture/diagram_dependency_commons_ui.png"> | <img src="screenshots/architecture/diagram_dependency_commons_views.png"> |


#### Libraries modules

The `:libraries` modules are an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library), basically contains different utilities that can be used by the different modules.

<p align="center">
 <img src="screenshots/architecture/diagram_dependency_libraries_test_utils.png">
</p>

### Architecture components

Ideally, ViewModels shouldn’t know anything about Android. This improves testability, leak safety and modularity. ViewModels have different scopes than activities or fragments. While a ViewModel is alive and running, an activity can be in any of its lifecycle states. Activities and fragments can be destroyed and created again while the ViewModel is unaware.

Passing a reference of the View (activity or fragment) to the ViewModel is a serious risk. Lets assume the ViewModel requests data from the network and the data comes back some time later. At that moment, the View reference might be destroyed or might be an old activity that is no longer visible, generating a memory leak and, possibly, a crash.

<img src="screenshots/architecture/diagram_communication_layers.png">

The communication between the different layers follow the above diagram using the reactive paradigm, observing changes on components without need of callbacks avoiding leaks and edge cases related with them.

### Build variants

The application has different product flavours: `Dev`, `QA`, `Prod`. Each variant has a specific target environment and to make easier to distinguish them the app uses a specific icon colour for `debug` and `release` build variant with descriptive app name. In this case and given that it's a sample, all variants have the same Marvel API endpoint.
But the idea is to have different environments target for Development and QA respectively, what doesn't affect the production environment. This is applicable to any tool, platform, service what is being used. For more information about build variant, check this [link](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants).

| Types   | DEV                                                                             | QA                                                                             | PROD                                                                         |
