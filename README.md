Android Components Architecture in a Modular Word is a sample project that presents modern, 2020 approach to [Android](https://www.android.com/) application development using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and latest tech-stack.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate best practices, provide a set of guidelines, and present modern Android
application architecture that is modular, scalable, maintainable and testable. This application may look simple, but it
has all of these small details that will set the rock-solid foundation of the larger app suitable for bigger teams and
long application lifecycle management.

## Development

### Environment setup

First off, you require the latest Android Studio 4.1.0 (or newer) to be able to build the app.

You need to supply keys for Marvel API. You can find information about how to gain access by using the [link](https://developer.marvel.com).

When you obtain the keys, you can provide them to the app by putting the following in the `local.properties` project root file:

```properties
#Marvel API KEYS
marvel.key.public = <insert>
marvel.key.private = <insert>
```

## Architecture

The architecture of the application is based, apply and strictly complies with each of the following 5 points:

<img src="screenshots/architecture/project_structure.png" width="300" align="right" hspace="20">

-   A single-activity architecture, using the [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) to manage fragment operations.
-   [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), part of Android Jetpack for give to project a robust design, testable and maintainable.
-   Pattern [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) (MVVM) facilitating a [separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) of development of the graphical user interface.
-   [S.O.L.I.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.
-   [Modular app architecture](https://proandroiddev.com/build-a-modular-android-app-architecture-25342d99de82) allows to be developed features in isolation, independently from other features.

### Modules

Modules are collection of source files and build settings that allow you to divide a project into discrete units of functionality. In this case apart from dividing by functionality/responsibility, existing the following dependence between them:

<p align="center">
 <img src="screenshots/architecture/diagram_communication_modules.png">
</p>

The above graph shows the app modularisation:
-   `:app` depends on `:core` and indirectly depends on `:features` by dynamic-features.
-   `:features` modules depends on `:commons`, `:core`, `:libraries` and `:app`.
-   `:core` and `:commons` only depends for possible utils on `:libraries`.
-   `:libraries` don’t have any dependency.

#### App module

The `:app` module is an [com.android.application](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/), which is needed to create the app bundle.  It is also responsible for initiating the [dependency graph](https://github.com/google/dagger), [play core](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/play/core/release-notes) and another project global libraries, differentiating especially between different app environments.

## Documentation

The documentation is generated following [KDoc](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kotlin-doc.html) language (the equivalent of Java's [JavaDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc)) via documentation engine for Kotlin [Dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka).

To consult it check this [link](https://vyshas.github.io/android-modular-architecture/) or open the project `/docs` directory.

## Tech-stack

This project takes advantage of many popular libraries, plugins and tools of the Android ecosystem. Most of the libraries are in the stable version, unless there is a good reason to use non-stable dependency.

### Dependencies

-   [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack):
    -   [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html) - provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack and Android platform APIs.
    -   [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - major improvement to the original Android [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.
    -   [Benchmark](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/benchmark.html) - handles warmup, measures your code performance, and outputs benchmarking results to the Android Studio console.
    -   [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) - allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
    -   [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
    -   [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
    -   [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/) - helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.
    -   [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/) - helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time. Loading partial data on demand reduces usage of network bandwidth and system resources.
    -   [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
    -   [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
-   [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.
-   [Dagger2](https://dagger.dev/) - dependency injector for replacement all FactoryFactory classes.
-   [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - type-safe HTTP client.
-   [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) - image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
-   [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - makes it easy to parse JSON into Kotlin objects.
-   [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
-   [Stetho](http://facebook.github.io/stetho/) - debug bridge for applications via Chrome Developer Tools.
-   [and more...](https://github.com/vyshas/kotlin-sample-app/blob/master/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/dependencies/Dependencies.kt)
